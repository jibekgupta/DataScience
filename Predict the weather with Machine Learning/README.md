# Forecasting Weather Patterns with Ridge Regression

## Project Overview
Accurate weather forecasting is vital for fields like agriculture, disaster management, and daily planning.
In this project, we utilize Ridge Regression, a linear regression model with regularization, to predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
This project guides you through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
